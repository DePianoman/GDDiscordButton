# GDDiscordButton
Adds a Discord Button to your Geometry Dash Profile

## Installation

WITH MHv6:

Drag ProfileButton.dll into your Geometry Dash folder. Edit "absolutedlls" and add a line at the bottom that says "ProfileButton.dll"

WITHOUT MHv6:

Use something like [Adaf's DLL Loader](https://github.com/adafcaefc/GDDLLLoader) or the GuidedHacking DLL loader to load this file.

## Custom Discord Button

If you would like to change the texture of the discord button, you may do so by placing a replacement image in the Resources folder titled "discordbutton.png".
It MUST be a PNG, and MUST be the same dimensions as the original texture. If you would like a copy of the original texture, you can find it in the repository above.
