# GDDiscordButton
Adds a Discord Button to your Geometry Dash Profile

## Installation

WITH MHv6:

Drag ProfileButton.dll into your Geometry Dash folder. Edit "absolutedlls" and add a line at the bottom that says "ProfileButton.dll"

WITHOUT MHv6:

Use something like [Adaf's DLL Loader](https://github.com/adafcaefc/GDDLLLoader) or the GuidedHacking DLL loader to load this file.
